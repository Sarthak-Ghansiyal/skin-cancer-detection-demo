# Overview :

This project demonstrates an AI-powered skin cancer detection system. Users can upload an image of a skin lesion, and the application will predict whether it is benign or malignant. The model is built using TensorFlow and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.



## How It Works :

1.The user uploads a skin lesion image.
2.The image is resized to 64Ã—64 pixels, normalized, and reshaped for the model.
3.The TensorFlow model processes the image and predicts the likelihood of malignancy.
4.The application displays the result (Benign/Malignant) along with the confidence score.

THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS WHEN TESTED :
